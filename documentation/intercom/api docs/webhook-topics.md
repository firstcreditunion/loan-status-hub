## Handling Webhook notifications

You will receive notifications on your chosen topics when you set up a subscription. How you handle those notifications, i.e. the HTTP status code returned, will determine the subsequent state of that subscription.

Timeout
You have 5 seconds to respond to a notification. If you don't send a response within that time, the notification is treated as failed and will be retried only once after 1 minute. If you respond with too many error responses, we drop future notifications for a period of 15 minutes.

| Response Code      | Description              | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2xx                | Success                  | The webhook was successfully delivered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 410                | Gone                     | When a 410 is received, we assume the resource is no longer available. We will disable the subscription and no more notifications will be sent.                                                                                                                           |
| 429                | Too many requests        | When a 429 is received, all notifications from that subscription will be throttled. Depending on the rate of delivery, this delay can be between 1 minute to 2 hours. If 429s continue and any notification is delayed for > 2 hours then we will drop that notification. |
| 4xx (excl. 429)5xx | Client or service errors | We will retry after 1 minute for all other errors. If the 2nd retry fails then we mark the notification delivery as failed.                                                                                                                                               |

## Signed notifications

Intercom signs webhook notifications via an `X-Hub-Signature` header. We do this so that you can verify that the notification came from Intercom by decoding the signature.

We compute the value of this `X-Hub-Signature` header by creating a signature using the body of the JSON request and your App's `client_secret` value, which you can find on the Basic Info page of your App.

The signature is the hexadecimal (40-byte) representation of an SHA-1 signature computed using the HMAC algorithm defined in [RFC2104](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104).

The `X-Hub-Signature` header value starts with the string `sha1=` followed by the signature.

```http
POST https://example.org/hooks
User-Agent: intercom-parrot-service-client/1.0
X-Hub-Signature: sha1=21ff2e149e0fdcac6f947740f6177f6434bda921
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "type" : "notification_event",
  "id" : "notif_78c122d0-23ba-11e4-9464-79b01267cc2e",
  "topic" : "user.created",
  "app_id" : "a86dr8yl",
  "data" : {
    "type" : "notification_event_data",
    "item" : {
      "type" : "user",
      "id" : "530370b477ad7120001d",
      "user_id" : "25",
      "name" : "Joe Example",
      "unsubscribed_from_emails" : false,
      "custom_attributes" : {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Admin notification object

The Admin notification object is similar to the [model returned via the API](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/references/rest-api/api.intercom.io/Admins/admin/). You can see an example object below:

```json
{
  "type": "admin",
  "id": "1",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@intercom.io",
  "job_title": "CEO",
  "away_mode_enabled": true,
  "away_mode_reassign": false,
  "away_status_reason": "ðŸ” On lunch",
  "has_inbox_seat": true,
  "team_ids": []
}
```

## Contact Tag notification object

We only return the Contact Tag notification object for Webhooks. You can see an example object below:

```json
{
  "type": "contact_tag",
  "created_at": 1392731331,
  "tag" : {
      "id": "1287",
      "name": "independent",
      "type": "tag"
    },
  "contact" : {
      "type": "contact",
      "id": "1287ab1287fefe",
        ........
  }
}
```

A Contact Tag notification object is composed from the existing Contact and Tag objects and is sent when Contacts are tagged and untagged via the `contact.user.tag.created`, `contact.lead.tag.created`, `contact.lead.tag.deleted` and `contact.user.tag.deleted` topics.

| Attribute  | Type      | Description                                  |
| ---------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| type       | string    | Value is 'contact_tag'.                      |
| created_at | timestamp | The time the contact tag object was created. |
| tag        | Tag       | The tag that was added or removed.           |
| contact    | contact   | The contact that was tagged or untagged.     |

## Content Stat notification object

We only return the Content Stat notification object for Webhooks. You can see an example object below:

       "data": [],
       "total_count": 0
     },
     "series_id": 1,
     "series_title": null,
     "node_id": 3
  },
  "contact": {
    "type": "contact",
    "id": "6318db7dfb80c614fe1792b5",
    ...
  }
}
```
